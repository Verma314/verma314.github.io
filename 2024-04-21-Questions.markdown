#### On thinking

1. What is critical thinking? 

2. What is logic? How do humans do it and can machines replicate it?

3. What is the nature of logical thought? Biological basis? How do brains verify logical correctness, even though brains are one of the only sources of validating logic?

#### On computing

1. What is the best and cleanest way to find out the network/HTTP operations being carried out when we perform a task on the browser? For example: uploading a file.

#### On learning and expertise

1. Is gaining expertise a matter of identity and self-belief? 

"I am the kind of person who finishes things and learns them really deep" vs "I am a person who kinda sorta learns about things and never follows throught".

Possibly these beliefs trickle down into actions and form a virtuous/vicious cycle.

"I am a person that values rigor and goes into the trenches no matter how hard it gets" vs "I am a person who only looks and does things at a surface level"
