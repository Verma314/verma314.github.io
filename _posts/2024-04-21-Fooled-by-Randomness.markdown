* The cetral premise seems to say that humans see patterns where there are none. And very dangerously successes are often attribtued to skill when it has only been sheer luck.

On left: the truth vs, on right: what humans confuse the truth for:

* Asks us to be suspicious of 'experts' that offer certainity; more advisable to listen to 
experts who talk about the irrationality and unreliability of human thought. People such as Daniel Kahneman, Karl Popper, Maynard Keynes, Hayek, Adam Smith

Humans are defective and faulty.

Bounded rationality.
Heuristic and biases.

We need to get around our emotions instead of grandiose moralizing of overcoming the human-ness. We need tricks.

### Alternate Histories or Parallel Timelines

* In life and risk-taking, always look at 'alternative histories.'

£10 million earned from dentistry and £10 million earned from a lottery are vastly different qualitatively. Even though for an accountant they are the same.

In trading, when taking risks make sure to take them in such a way that in n number of alternate universe timelines that risk should pan out in a good number of them.

A dentist having studied dentistry will have the same/similar outcome in 1 million universes, as opposed to a person who invests in lottery tickets.

* Life's successes/failures are similar to russian roulette. Ask yourself is your success coming from a genuine skill or dumb luck? Go to the source of the wealth creation (skill vs lotto tickets?) -- this is called `the generator`

Always seek for the generator.

* Look for the invisible risks of blowup in your 'portfolio'
