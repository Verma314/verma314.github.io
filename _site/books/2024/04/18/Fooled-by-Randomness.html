  <li>The cetral premise seems to say that humans see patterns where there are none. And very dangerously successes are often attribtued to skill when it has only been sheer luck.</li>
</ul>

<p>On left: the truth vs, on right: what humans confuse the truth for:
<img src="/assets/Distinctions.png" alt="image info" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Asks us to be suspicious of ‘experts’ that offer certainity; more advisable to listen to 
experts who talk about the irrationality and unreliability of human thought. People such as Daniel Kahneman, Karl Popper, Maynard Keynes, Hayek, Adam Smith</li>
</ul>

<p>Humans are defective and faulty.</p>

<p><em>To check out:</em>
Bounded rationality.
Heuristic and biases.
Check out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability
Charles Sanders Pierce</p>

<p>We need to get around our emotions instead of grandiose moralizing of overcoming the human-ness. We need tricks.</p>

<h3 id="alternate-histories-or-parallel-timelines">Alternate Histories or Parallel Timelines</h3>

<ul>
  <li>In life and risk-taking, always look at ‘alternative histories.’</li>
</ul>

<p>£10 million earned from dentistry and £10 million earned from a lottery are vastly different qualitatively. Even though for an accountant they are the same.</p>

<p>In trading, when taking risks make sure to take them in such a way that in n number of alternate universe timelines that risk should pan out in a good number of them.</p>

<p>A dentist having studied dentistry will have the same/similar outcome in 1 million universes, as opposed to a person who invests in lottery tickets.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Life’s successes/failures are similar to russian roulette. Ask yourself is your success coming from a genuine skill or dumb luck? Go to the source of the wealth creation (skill vs lotto tickets?) – this is called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">the generator</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Always seek for the generator.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Look for the invisible risks of blowup in your ‘portfolio’</li>
</ul>
